Comparisons from 'Portal da Queixa'.

A Website done with Flask (in Python) comparing companies' ratings from a Portuguese website called "Portal da Queixa". 

In this site you can search for companies in Portugal and compare their ratings from 'Portal da Queixa', a website where costumers evaluate the companies they have had any experience with.

I have created a website using: Flask, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, Nord and GoogleFonts.
I have used libraries such as: Pandas, Numpy, BeautifulSoup, requests and googletrans (for translation of the dataset from Portuguese to English). 

The step by step of this project was: 
1. Web Scraping through 'Portal da Queixa' getting all the info.
2. Data Cleaning
3. Translating the database into English.
4. Building the Flask Page and bringing the database into it.
5. Results, showing off the comparisons.

So, you can enter the website, choose the companies you want to compare and see how they were evaluated by their customers in Portugal. It's useful when you are in doubt in choosing a company for a specific necessity and want to see what the clients thought of their services.
